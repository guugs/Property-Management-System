# 🏠 Property Management System

Welcome to the **Property Management System**! This was my final group project for my **third-year Software Engineering course**. This is a web application designed to help property owners, managers, and tenants simplify the process of managing properties, leases, tenants, and maintenance requests – all in one place!

## 🚀 Features

- **User Authentication**: Register and log in as a property owner, manager, or tenant. Different user roles have different permissions!
- **Property Management**: Add, edit, and remove properties. Easily assign tenants to the properties you're managing.
- **Lease Tracking**: Create, update, and store lease agreements. Stay on top of lease terms without any hassle.
- **Maintenance Requests**: Tenants can submit maintenance requests, and managers can track and update their status.
- **Reporting**: Generate reports on property occupancy and maintenance requests for better property oversight.
